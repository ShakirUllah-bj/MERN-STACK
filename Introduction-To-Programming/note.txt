Introduction to programming

I. What is Programming?
Programming is the process of instructing a computer to perform a specific tast or a set of tasks.

Key Concept:
Writing a series of step-by-step instructions that a computer can understand and execute.
Solving problems and automating tasks through code.

II. why learn Programming?

Empowerment:
ability to create software applications , websites, and automate processes.
Enhances porblem-solving skills and logical thinking.

Versatility:
Applicability in various domains such as web development, mobile apps, data scence, and more.
Increasing demand for indivisuals with programming skills across industries.

III. Programming Languages
A programming language ia sa formal system designed to communicate instructions to a computer.

Examples:
JavaScript, Python, Java, C/C++, C# and many more.
Each language has unique syntax and features.

IV. How Computer Understand Programming Languages?

Binary Code:
Computers use binary code (0s and 1s) as their native language.
Machine code consists of instructions directly executed by the computer's 
central processing unit (CPU).

Interpreters and Compilers:
Interpreters translate code line-by-line at runtime.
Compilers translate the entire code ino machine code before execution.

V. High-level VS Low-level Languages

High-level Languages:
Closer to human languages, making it easier to read and write.

Example: python, javascript, c, c# etc.

Low-level Language:
Closer to machine code, more challenging for humans to read and write.
Example: assembly language.
